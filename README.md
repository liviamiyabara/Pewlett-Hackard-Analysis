# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Week 7, module Employee Database with SQL

## Employee Database Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large established company with thousands of employees, its ‘baby-boomers’ began to retire at a fast rate, so the company needs to understand how many employees will be eligible for the retirement packages and Pewlett-Hackard needs to plan which positions will need to be filled in as the number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of jobs opened.

Bobby, the HR analysis, needs help to perform an employee research to find out who will be retiring soon and how many positions Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill. The employee information is only available in 6 csv files, so this will be a good opportunity to move away from excel/VBA and transition to SQL in order to improve data gathering, consolidation and analysis.



## Results
#### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

* There are more than 90 thousand employees of retirement-age in Pewlett-Hackard

* The company needs to prepare a plan to fill in such a large number of jobs. Majority of positions are for Senior Engineer and Senior Staff 

* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the Mentorship program 

* Pewlett-Hackard has more than 300,000 employees and 30% of their workforce is on retirement age. The company should create a plan not only to mentor employees to fill in the senior roles, but also create campaigns to attract external talent

## Summary
#### Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

* How many roles will need to be filled as the “silver tsunami” begins to make an impact? 
  There are 90,398 employees born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Their roles will need to be filled in as the “silver tsunami” begins to take effect.
 
* Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees? 
  Based on the criteria applied (employees whose birth dates are between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965) there is only 1,549 employees eligible for the Mentorship program and a more than 90 thousand employees ready to retire. It would not be feasible to assume that each mentor would have 58 mentees. The HR department should invest in other types of training and plan campaigns to attract external talent.
