# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Week 7, module Employee Database with SQL

## Employee Database Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large established company with thousands of employees, its ‘baby-boomers’ began to retire at a fast rate, so the company needs to understand how many employees will be eligible for the retirement packages and Pewlett-Hackard needs to plan which positions will need to be fill in as the number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of jobs opened.

Bobby, the HR analysis, needs help to perform an employee research to find out who will be retiring soon and how many positions Pewlett-Hackard will need to fill. The employee information is only available in 6 csv files, so this will be a good opportunity to move away from excel/VBA and transition to SQL in order to improve data gathering, consolidation and analysis.

####Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
